# Service-Oriented Modifiability Patterns Experiment

To provide empirical support for the impact of service-based patterns on modifiability this repo contains two functionally equivalent systems, one as a pattern version and one as a non-pattern version.

Several exercises have to be performed on the systems to measure the effect of the patterns.
