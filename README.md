# Service-Oriented Modifiability Experiment

To provide empirical support for the modifiability of service-based sytems this repo contains two functionally equivalent WebShop systems.

Several exercises have to be performed on the systems within a certain timeframe. Both effectiveness and efficiency are measured for each version.

Required:
- JDK >=1.8
- Maven >=3.5.0
- Node.js >=8.0.0
- A Java IDE (recommended: Eclipse)
- A Web IDE (recommended: Visual Studio Code)
- For version 2 of the system: Apache Kafka >=1.1.0
- A web browser (recommended: Chrome)
