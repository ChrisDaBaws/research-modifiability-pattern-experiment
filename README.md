# Service-Oriented Modifiability Experiment

To provide empirical support for the modifiability of service-based sytems this repo contains two functionally equivalent WebShop systems.

Several exercises have to be performed on the systems within a certain timeframe. Both effectiveness and efficiency should be measured for each version.

Required:

- [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) >=1.8
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) >=3.5.0
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) >=8.0.0
- A Java IDE (recommended: [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads))
- A Web IDE (recommended: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))
- For version 2 of the system: [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads) >=1.1.0
- A modern web browser (recommended: [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome))

Please choose a version and refer to the README in the respective workspace folder. The exercise evaluation web UI is the same for both versions (`./exercise-validation`).
